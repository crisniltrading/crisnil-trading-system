# Profile Picture Feature - Complete Implementation âœ…

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Backend** (Already Working)
- âœ… Profile picture stored as base64 in MongoDB
- âœ… Upload endpoint: `POST /api/users/profile/picture`
- âœ… Delete endpoint: `DELETE /api/users/profile/picture`
- âœ… 5MB file size limit
- âœ… Image validation

### 2. **Frontend JavaScript** (Updated)
**File:** `frontend/profile-settings.js`

Added functions:
- âœ… `handleProfilePictureUpload()` - Converts image to base64 and uploads
- âœ… `handleProfilePictureDelete()` - Deletes profile picture
- âœ… `displayProfilePicture()` - Shows picture in all locations
- âœ… Event listeners for upload and delete buttons

### 3. **Frontend HTML** (Updated)
**File:** `frontend/index.html`

Updated sections:
- âœ… Profile picture upload area (line ~2955)
- âœ… Sidebar avatar display (line ~2911)
- âœ… Header avatar display (line ~607)
- âœ… Delete button with proper ID
- âœ… File input with correct accept attribute

### 4. **Frontend CSS** (Updated)
**File:** `frontend/styles.css`

Added styles for:
- âœ… Profile picture upload section
- âœ… Upload placeholder
- âœ… Preview image styling
- âœ… Avatar displays (header & sidebar)
- âœ… Hover effects

## How It Works

### Upload Flow:
1. User clicks upload area or "Click to upload"
2. File picker opens (images only)
3. JavaScript converts image to base64
4. Sends to backend API
5. Updates localStorage
6. Displays in 3 places:
   - Form preview
   - Sidebar avatar
   - Header avatar

### Display Logic:
- If profile picture exists â†’ Show image, hide initials
- If no profile picture â†’ Show initials, hide image
- Delete button only visible when picture exists

## Testing Steps

### 1. Upload Picture
```
1. Login to the system
2. Click user avatar in header
3. Click "Profile Settings"
4. Go to "Profile Information" tab
5. Click the upload area
6. Select an image (< 5MB)
7. Picture should appear immediately in:
   - Upload preview
   - Sidebar avatar
   - Header avatar
```

### 2. Verify Persistence
```
1. Refresh the page
2. Picture should still be visible
3. Check localStorage â†’ user object should have profilePicture field
```

### 3. Delete Picture
```
1. Open Profile Settings
2. Click "Delete Picture" button
3. Confirm deletion
4. Picture should disappear
5. Initials should reappear
```

## API Endpoints

### Upload Profile Picture
```http
POST /api/users/profile/picture
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "imageData": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Profile picture uploaded successfully!",
  "profilePicture": "data:image/png;base64,..."
}
```

### Delete Profile Picture
```http
DELETE /api/users/profile/picture
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Profile picture deleted successfully!"
}
```

**Cause:** Missing display logic
**Solution:** âœ… Fixed - Added `displayProfilePicture()` function

### Issue: Picture disappears on refresh
**Cause:** Not saved to localStorage
